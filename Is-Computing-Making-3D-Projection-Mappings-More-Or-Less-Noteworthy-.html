Depending on the required outcome, projectors allow for high-quality images to be projected on to any surface at any size. Each projection Head is designed with a closed-loop cooling system, essentially sealing all of the critical optical components from ingress of contaminants. Today, machine learning is helping make more sophisticated mapping processes possible at a lower cost. <br /><br />You need relate to people and position yourself on the same level as them. The costs of projection mapping tend to vary. This gave us a great indication of how the content would work with the building and was also a valuable tool for client presentations.
